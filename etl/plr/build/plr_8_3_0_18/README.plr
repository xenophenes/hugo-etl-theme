See http://www.joeconway.com/plr.html for release notes and latest docs

Notes:
    - R headers are required. Download and install R prior to building
      PL/R.

    - R must have been built with the --enable-R-shlib option when it was
      configured, in order for the libR shared object library to be available.

    - R_HOME must be defined in the environment of the user under which
      PostgreSQL is started, before the postmaster is started. Otherwise
      PL/R will refuse to load.

Installation:
  See http://www.joeconway.com/doc/plr-install.html
