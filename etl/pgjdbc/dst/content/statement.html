     The following must be considered when using the
     <code>
      Statement
     </code>
     or
     <code>
      PreparedStatement
     </code>
     interface:
    </p>
    <ul>
     <li>
      You can use a single
      <code>
       Statement
      </code>
      instance as many times as you want. You could
create one as soon as you open the connection and use it for the connection's
lifetime. But you have to remember that only one
      <code>
       ResultSet
      </code>
      can exist
per
      <code>
       Statement
      </code>
      or
      <code>
       PreparedStatement
      </code>
      at a given time.
     </li>
     <li>
      If you need to perform a query while processing a
      <code>
       ResultSet
      </code>
      , you can simply
create and use another
      <code>
       Statement
      </code>
      .
     </li>
     <li>
      If you are using threads, and several are using the database, you must use a
separate
      <code>
       Statement
      </code>
      for each thread. Refer to
      <a href="thread.html">
       Chapter 10,
       <em>
        Using the Driver in a Multithreaded or a Servlet Environment
       </em>
      </a>
      if you are thinking of using threads, as it covers some important points.
     </li>
     <li>
      When you are done using the
      <code>
       Statement
      </code>
      or
      <code>
       PreparedStatement
      </code>
      you should close
it.
     </li>
     <li>
      In JDBC, the question mark (
      <code>
       ?
      </code>
      ) is the placeholder for the positional parameters of a
      <code>
       PreparedStatement
      </code>
      .
There are, however, a number of PostgreSQL operators that contain a question mark.
To keep such question marks in a SQL statement from being interpreted as positional parameters,
use two question marks (
      <code>
       ??
      </code>
      ) as escape sequence.
You can also use this escape sequence in a
      <code>
       Statement
      </code>
      , but that is not required.
Specifically only in a
      <code>
       Statement
      </code>
      a single (
      <code>
       ?
      </code>
      ) can be used as an operator.
