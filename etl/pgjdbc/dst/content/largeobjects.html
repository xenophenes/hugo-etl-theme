     Large objects are supported in the standard JDBC specification. However, that
interface is limited, and the API provided by PostgreSQL  allows for random
access to the objects contents, as if it was a local file.
    </p>
    <p>
     The org.postgresql.largeobject package provides to Java the libpq C interface's
large object API. It consists of two classes,
     <code>
      LargeObjectManager
     </code>
     , which deals
with creating, opening and deleting large objects, and
     <code>
      LargeObject
     </code>
     which deals
with an individual object.  For an example usage of this API, please see
     <a href="binary-data.html#binary-data-example">
      Example 7.1, "Processing Binary Data in JDBC"
     </a>
     .
