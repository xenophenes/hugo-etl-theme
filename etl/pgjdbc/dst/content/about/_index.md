**PostgreSQL JDBC Driver** (*PgJDBC* for short) allows Java programs to
connect to a PostgreSQL database using standard, database independent
Java code. Is an open source JDBC driver written in Pure Java (Type 4),
and communicates in the PostgreSQL native network protocol.

 The current version of the driver should be compatible with
**PostgreSQL 8.2 and higher**, and **Java 6** (JDBC 4.0), **Java 7**
(JDBC 4.1), **Java 8** (JDBC 4.2) and **Java 9**.

## Features

The driver provides a reasonably complete implementation of the JDBC
specification in addition to some PostgreSQL specific extensions. Our
goal is nothing short of full compliance, but we're not there yet. Some
features require additional backend support and others just need someone
to implement them. For a list of what still needs to be done see our
[Todo](../development/todo) list.
