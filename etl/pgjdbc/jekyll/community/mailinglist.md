Before Mailing Anyone {.underlined_10}
---------------------

Before posting a question or problem to the mailing list, please first
look at the following resources:

-   [FAQ](../documentation/faq.html)
-   [Documentation](../documentation/documentation.html)
-   Mailing list [archives](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-jdbc),
    (Google interface to [newer
    messages](http://groups.google.com/group/pgsql.interfaces.jdbc).)
-   Consider upgrading your JDBC driver to the latest version. It should
    be backwards compatible and may fix your problem.

General List - pgsql-jdbc@postgresql.org {.underlined_10}
----------------------------------------

This mailing list is for all PostgreSQL Java/JDBC related discussions.
This is the place for bug reports, feature requests, help with problem
solving, and pretty much anything involving Java and PostgreSQL.
Messages from people who are not subscribed to the list will be held for
moderator approval in an effort to cut down on spam. Archives and
subscription information is available on the main [PostgreSQL
site](http://archives.postgresql.org/pgsql-jdbc/).

When asking for help or reporting a problem please try to include as
much information as possible. Good things to note are:

-   JDBC driver build number
-   Server version
-   Exact error message and stacktrace
-   What you were doing, ideally in code form

* * * * *

Commit Messages - jdbc-commits@pgfoundry.org {.underlined_10}
--------------------------------------------

This mailing list is for people interested in carefully monitoring the
development process. The mailing list was active until the code base was
transferred to GitHub in late 2012. Every commit to this earlier CVS
repository sent out an email with the log message and links to diffs. So
the archive of this list, [pgfoundry
site](http://lists.pgfoundry.org/mailman/listinfo/jdbc-commits), holds
the history of activity with the driver prior to 2013.

Currently activity on commits is best observed directly from the git
repository hosted with [GitHub](https://github.com/pgjdbc/pgjdbc). The
console tool, gitk, available with a git installation is an excellent
GUI tool to observe commits.
